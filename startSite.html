-What this webpage will be:
-A portfolio for all of my work
all of the normal text in the page which would usually be paragraphs will be
written in prose, just because it's interesting and different and I think it 
would lend itself to creating a very unique website and learning a lot of new
skills
-When you go to a new part of the page the words on your current page will fade
out, and the words on the next page will come in rhythmically in time with how
you would read them in a poem. 
-On some pages the words will fade in rhythmically, on some they will come in 
from the side, and maybe on one they will wipe to become visible OR maybe on one
all of the letters will initially be letters very jumbled and changing to new 
letters every half second and as time goes on they will sort themselves into
actual words (like the dyslexia site except they actually organize eventually)
-At the top left will be my logo, which will bring you back to the main page
which is just a few words centered in the page
-At the top left will be a horizontal list of links to all of the parts of the page
-There is a black box that surrounds the page you are currently on on the top
left,and the words in it will be white instead of black. When you shift pages 
the box will animate to shrink down into a line a line and then the line will
dissapear
-When hovering over pages you are not currently on there is a black outline 
rectangle that slides to go to the element you are currently selecting,
When you select a new page to go to this box fills in with black from the top
going to the bottom, the opposite of what happens when you leave a page
