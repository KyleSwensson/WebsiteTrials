-What this webpage will be:
-A portfolio for all of my work
all of the normal text in the page which would usually be paragraphs will be
written in prose, just because it's interesting and different and I think it 
would lend itself to creating a very unique website and learning a lot of new
skills
-When you go to a new part of the page the words on your current page will fade
out, and the words on the next page will come in rhythmically in time with how
you would read them in a poem. 
-On some pages the words will fade in rhythmically, on some they will come in 
from the side, and maybe on one they will wipe to become visible OR maybe on one
all of the letters will initially be letters very jumbled and changing to new 
letters every half second and as time goes on they will sort themselves into
actual words (like the dyslexia site except they actually organize eventually)
-At the top left will be my logo, which will bring you back to the main page
which is just a few words centered in the page
-At the top left will be a horizontal list of links to all of the parts of the page
-There is a black box that surrounds the page you are currently on on the top
left,and the words in it will be white instead of black. When you shift pages 
the box will animate to shrink down into a line a line and then the line will
dissapear
-When hovering over pages you are not currently on there is a black outline 
rectangle that slides to go to the element you are currently selecting,
When you select a new page to go to this box fills in with black from the top
going to the bottom, the opposite of what happens when you leave a page
-maybe have little underlines start as a point under the end of important words and then
extend into a line that spans the full word over time and then after a second
or so have them shrink back to a point but at the beginning of the word and then the point 
dissappear
-On resume page have the poem explaining the resume and then if you scroll down once or
if you press the down arrow that will appear at the bottom of the screen it will scroll all
the way down to a page just containing my resume
-The poem in projects will also do this for each individual project (the underline thing that is)
-In main page three icons will float in from below and be about project and
resume, they will fade in as they float up. once they reach the desired height
a stationary grey (slightly darker than background) box outline will fade in to surround
them giving them a button-like appearance. when you mouse over them the grey 
box around them will be filled in with a darker black box outline from bottom 
left to top right
-Instead of a symbol at the top left there will be another button which says 
home on it which brings you back to the index and the box will jump accross
the stage to get to it like it does for about projects and resume when you 
hover over it
-instead of having a box that moves to slide to whichever navigation element
you are hovering over it should just be a sliding outline going
under whatever element you are on. When you click it the sides grow up until 
they hit the top and then the top fills in from both sides and then the box 
fills with black up from the bottom
-Have links in projects section have a black outline box pulse around them starting from the bottom left then moving to the top right every 3 or so seconds to highlight that it is a link
-when hover over links in projects black rectangle filled encloses them and they
display a picture over the top of them, fading in from bottom

A story of my feats
so delicately composed
below is my resume
although not in prose
