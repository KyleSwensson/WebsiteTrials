-What this webpage will be:
-A portfolio for all of my work
all of the normal text in the page which would usually be paragraphs will be
written in prose, just because it's interesting and different and I think it 
would lend itself to creating a very unique website and learning a lot of new
skills
-When you go to a new part of the page the words on your current page will fade
out, and the words on the next page will come in rhythmically in time with how
you would read them in a poem. 
-On some pages the words will fade in rhythmically, on some they will come in 
from the side, and maybe on one they will wipe to become visible OR maybe on one
all of the letters will initially be letters very jumbled and changing to new 
letters every half second and as time goes on they will sort themselves into
actual words (like the dyslexia site except they actually organize eventually)
-At the top left will be my logo, which will bring you back to the main page
which is just a few words centered in the page
-At the top left will be a horizontal list of links to all of the parts of the page
-There is a black box that surrounds the page you are currently on on the top
left,and the words in it will be white instead of black. When you shift pages 
the box will animate to shrink down into a line a line and then the line will
dissapear
-When hovering over pages you are not currently on there is a black outline 
rectangle that slides to go to the element you are currently selecting,
When you select a new page to go to this box fills in with black from the top
going to the bottom, the opposite of what happens when you leave a page
-maybe have little underlines start as a point under the end of important words and then
extend into a line that spans the full word over time and then after a second
or so have them shrink back to a point but at the beginning of the word and then the point 
dissappear
-On resume page have the poem explaining the resume and then if you scroll down once or
if you press the down arrow that will appear at the bottom of the screen it will scroll all
the way down to a page just containing my resume
-footer is a slightly off shade of grey at the bottom, header is the same color as rest of the page
-on the homepage have a poem be typed out that mentions about projects and 
resume. with the words about project and resume being links. These links
should be in a slightly different color and in bolder font than all the other
texts and when you mouse over them a point should appear under the right
bottom corner and grow to an underline, when mouse over i ended the underline
will shrink to a point in the bottom left corner.
-The poem in projects will also do this for each individual project

	<p id="aboutPara"> Hello! I'm Kyle. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at The University of British Columbia. I am a third year, but my expected graduation date is May 2019 because my degree has been extended by multiple co-op terms. I currently call Vancouver home, but I lived in Massachusetts for most of my life, and I'm interested in living in all sorts of different places in the future. I'm interested in all aspects of software development, and I've had a lot of experience working on projects involving game development, web app development. Some highlights of my industry experience are the 8 months i spent at Tasktop Technologies, my previous role as an events director at the AMS Game Development Association, and completing a game with some of the founders of the AMS Game Development Association and publishing it on Steam. I am actively looking for work, so feel free to contact me with any work opportunities! I'm willing to temporarily relocate, and I can work for periods of 4 to 12 months.
